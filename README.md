```'Network Engineer (Aspiring Software Developer)'```

I'm a Network Engineer with a passion for learning software development. I've been programming on and off for a few years now but I got my real first tatse of programming when I created a python script to automate some processes at work. The first was an automation script that would cycle through 40+ UniFi Network Controllers and get a list of Access Points that were offline and then generate a post in a teams channel for the NOC team to look into. After this I was hooked on programming and have continued to learn more. I am excited to see where this journey takes me!
