**'Network Engineer (Aspiring DevOps Engineer)'**

Growing up in the age of technology is an exciting journey! Hi my name is Alex I am a Network Engineer who is on a journey to learn more about tech. I started out as a Network Engineer and have recently been introduced to the world of DevOps and boy is it exciting (sorry I'm a real nerd when it comes to technology 😁) I am currently working on many projects for a boot camp so why not take a journey with me and together we can learn more about the topics of DevOps!
